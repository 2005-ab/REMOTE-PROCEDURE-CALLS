# Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Using xmlrpc_server in Python

This repository demonstrates how to implement Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in Python using the `xmlrpc.server` module, which is a part of the standard library. RPC allows for executing functions or methods on a remote server as if they were local, which is essential for distributed systems and service-based architectures.

## Introduction

The `xmlrpc.server` module in Python provides a straightforward way to implement an XML-RPC server that can expose Python functions as remote callable methods over HTTP. This repository includes an example of setting up an XML-RPC server and a client to communicate with it.

XML-RPC is a protocol that allows you to call methods on a remote server using XML to encode the request and HTTP to transport it.

## Features
- Simple implementation of XML-RPC server and client in Python
- Easy communication between remote systems
- Example of server-side method execution via remote procedure calls
- Supports argument passing and return values between client and server
